                     Divisibility rules are some shortcuts to find if an integer
                     is divisible by a number without actually doing the whole
                     division process. These rules can help us determine the
                     prime factorization relatively fast or in simplifying
                     fractions.

                     For example, let’s suppose a boy has 531 chocolates, and he
                     has to distribute them among his 9 friends. Dividing 531 by
                     9, we get no remainder, which means 531 is perfectly
                     divisible by 9. If that boy knows divisibility rules he can
                     easily tell whether or not he can divide the chocolates
                     equally. Let’s check all important divisibility rules.

                     Every number is divisible by 1. Divisibility rule for 1
                     doesn’t have any condition. Any number divided by 1 will
                     give the number itself, irrespective of how large the
                     number is. For example, 3 is divisible by 1 and 3000 is
                     also divisible by 1 completely.

                     check whether the sum is divisible by 3 or not. If the sum

                     For any number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible
                     by 3 as well as 4 simultaneously. So, the divisibility rule
                     of 3 and 4 is used together to check whether a number is
                     divisible by 12 or not.

                     For example, let’s check whether 3276 is divisible by 12 or

                     <p>Thus 3276 is divisible by 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        As 76 is the last two digits of 3276, and 76 is
                        divisible by 4 (76 = 4×19).
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, 3276 is divisible by 4 as well.</p>
                     <p>
                        As 3276 is divisible by 3 and 4 simultaneously, thus
                        3276 is divisible by 12 as well.
